# AutoHotKey Scripts

This repository will contain script that are compatible with the (free) [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) application. You do not need to download AutoHotKey if you will be using precompiled scripts. These can be found in the corresponding **Binaries** folder of the functionality and will contain a single .exe file.

## What is AutoHotKey

Ever wanted to automate some mouse or key actions? AutoHotKey is the right tool for the job. It's a fantastic scripting language that often lacks in decent documentation but can be extremely powerful. Most often, you will trigger a script through some key combination and watch the magic happen.

## Repository structure

In the root of the repository you will find folders, each folder containing a different set of script(s). On opening said folder, you will see following structure:

 - Folder **Binaries** => contains a single .exe file to execute as you like without the need for any installations
 - Folder **Scripts** => filled with the goodies (code) that creates the magic, feel free to adapt the code to your situation
 - File **README** *(Optional)* => can contain some details about the script
